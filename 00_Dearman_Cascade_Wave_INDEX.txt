KEY CONCEPTS:
------------

DIM Model: Dimensional Invariant Modulation
- Extends Navier-Stokes with resonant harmonic amplification
- Based on 3-6-9 frequency patterns
- Includes Larmor-like gyroscopic coupling
- Positioned as supplemental to Hopf bifurcation theory

Implied Magnetism:
- Universal magnetism through electron spin/orbital motion
- State-dependent magnetic response (solid/liquid/gas/plasma)
- Spin-centric framework for all matter

Resonance Amplification:
- Selective boost to Fourier modes (freq mod 3 ≈ 0)
- 124875 harmonic sequences
- Quasiperiodic solutions

Larmor Coupling:
- Gyroscopic term for vortex core stiffness
- Analogous to magnetic precession
- Weak coupling (β ≈ 0.1)

VALIDATION & FALSIFIABILITY:
----------------------------
- Delayed breakdown threshold (testable at Re=2500)
- Amplified circulation (measurable via velocity profiles)
- Spectral fingerprints (discrete peaks at 0.3k Strouhal)
- Deviations: 8-15 standard deviations from literature

All predictions are falsifiable and testable via:
- Tabletop experiments (rotating-lid cylinder)
- PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry)
- Spectral analysis
- Temperature-dependent susceptibility measurements
