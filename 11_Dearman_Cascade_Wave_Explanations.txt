Base-level explanations (intro-friendly)

1) What is magnetism?
Magnetism is a force associated with moving electric charges. When charges move (like electrons orbiting atoms or flowing in a wire), they create a magnetic field. Magnetic fields can push or pull on other magnets and on moving charges.

2) Harmonics and resonance (simple view)
Any vibration can be broken into a set of simple tones called harmonics. If two systems have compatible (matching or related) frequencies, they can resonate—energy transfers more easily, and the response becomes stronger.

3) Fields as the medium for interaction
A field is a way to describe how forces act across space. The magnetic field tells us the direction and strength of magnetic influence at each point. When systems share a field environment and their oscillations align, their interactions can increase.

4) Putting the ideas together (Dearman's framing)
If everything has some oscillatory behavior (even subtle), then each system could have a small magnetic or magnetism-like response. When frequencies align (harmonize), resonance can make the interaction stronger, leading to attraction or organization within the same field structure.

5) Important note
This synthesis is an intuitive, entry-level explanation. Parts of it align with known physics (fields, resonance); other parts (universal magnetism claim) are a hypothesis and would need clear definitions, measurements, and experiments to establish.

RELATION TO DIM MODEL:

The DIM (Dimensional Invariant Modulation) model applies similar principles to fluid dynamics:
- Vortex flows have natural frequencies (precession, rotation)
- DIM amplifies specific harmonic frequencies (3-6-9 patterns, 124875 sequences)
- When these frequencies resonate, the flow behavior changes dramatically:
  * Vortex breakdown is delayed
  * Circulation is amplified
  * New spectral peaks appear

This is analogous to how magnetic systems respond when their frequencies align—the interaction becomes stronger and more organized.
